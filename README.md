# TrisPython (Tic-Tac-Toe)

A simple command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game written in Python, where two players (X and O) take turns until there's a winner or the game ends in a draw.

## How to Play
1. Player **X** starts, followed by Player **O**.
2. Enter the coordinates for your move when prompted.
   - `x` is the column (0, 1, or 2).
   - `y` is the row (0, 1, or 2).
3. The game checks for a winner after each turn.
4. If the board is full with no winner, the game ends in a draw.
